# Fight-Detection
A machine-learning and deep-learning project.
Fight detection is part of action recognition tasks, which is one of the most difficult problems in computer vision because it requires recognising activities from videos and making predictions from a series of frames rather than just a single frame, so training an action recognition model is difficult.

We used two ways to fix the problem in this project.

1.Pretrained CNN is used to extract features from video frames, and the extracted frames are then passed to rnn to obtain the prediction. 
2.Using POSENET.
